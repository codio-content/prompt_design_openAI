## Refining the Results

Up until now, it should be clear just how powerful large language models like GPT-3 are. **Large language models (LLMs)** are machine learning algorithms that can recognize, summarize, translate, predict, and generate human languages on the basis of very large text-based datasets.

In short, you can apply models like GPT-3 virtually any task that involves understanding or generating natural language or code. Add the following prompt to the file on the left. Then click the `TRY IT` button. The model should return a working JavaScipt function.

write a recursive function in javascript that calculates the first n numbers of the fibonacci sequence
```

{Reset}(python3 reset.py 1)

Given the vast capabilities of large language models, we should stop asking what they can do. Instead, a better question would be, "How do we get better results?" Here are three basic guidelines to creating better results:

* **Show and tell**
* **Provide quality data**
* **Check your settings**

We will explore these guidelines over the course of this assignment.
