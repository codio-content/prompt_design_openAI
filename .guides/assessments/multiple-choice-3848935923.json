If you set the `top_p` value, it's like telling the jukebox to play any song, which could lead to a wide variety of tunes. This makes it pretty exciting because you never know what you'll hear next!\n\nBut if you use the `temperature` value, it's more like asking the jukebox to play mostly your favorite songs. It might mix in a few others, but it's mainly going to stick to the ones you know and love. This makes the playlist more predictable, or \"deterministic,\" because you have a pretty good idea of what songs will play.",
